\begin{abstract} 
The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) project is aiming at providing high-energy beams of ions of all elements
from hydrogen to uranium, as well as antiprotons and rare isotopes with high intensities. The existing accelerator facility of GSI  Helmholtz center for Heavy Ion Research GmbH (short: GSI) and the future FAIR facility employ a variety of circular accelerators like heavy ion synchrotrons (the SIS18 and the
SIS100) and storage rings (the experimental storage ring ESR, the CRYRING@ESR (short: CRYRING), the collector ring CR and the high energy storage ring HESR) for the preparation of secondary beams and experiments. Bunches are required to be transferred into rf buckets among GSI and FAIR circular accelerators for different purposes. All this imposes new requirements on the bunch-to-bucket transfer system. These requirements include the bunch-to-bucket transfer between two rings with an arbitrary ratio in their circumference, two synchronization methods (the phase shift method and the frequency beating method), the required bunch-to-bucket transfer time \SI{10}{\ms}, the tolerable bunch-to-bucket injection center mismatch less than $\pm1^\circ$ and the primary beam transfer as well as the secondary beam. In order to fulfill these requirements, a completely new and unique FAIR bunch-to-bucket transfer system will be developed. The presentation of the concept of the system and the systematic investigation from timing perspective are the purpose of this paper. The concept and basic procedure of the system first of all are presented. Afterwards, a systematic investigation from the beam dynamics, timing requirement of the transfer and kicker trigger perspectives is analyzed. Finally, the application of the system for all FAIR use cases with the frequency beating method is summarized.

%  After a bunch of particles is accelerated to the top energy, it must be extracted from the source synchrotron to be injected at, or at least be close to, the center of a bucket of the target synchrotron without the phase and energy error. e.g. From the SIS18, four batches\cite{batch} of the $U^{28+}$ at 200 MeV/u, each of two bunches (h = 2),  are injected into eight out of ten buckets of the  SIS100\cite{SIS18_100}
%\cite{SIS18} (see Fig.~\ref{fig1}). 
%
%\begin{figure}[!htb]

%   \caption{The bunch to bucket transfer of U$^{28+}$ from the SIS18 to the SIS100.}
%   \label{fig1}
%\end{figure}
% 
%  For properly transferring the beam from the source synchrotron to the target synchrotron, the phase between the beam and the bucket must be precisely controlled before it is ejected. The process of achieving the detailed phase adjustment is termed "synchronization". There are mainly two methods to realize the synchronization: the phase shift and the frequency beating, both of which are based on the RF frequency modulation. To achieve the a required phase shift, the RF frequency is modulated away from the a nominal value for a period of time and then modulated back. The frequency beating is an comparison between two RF signals of slightly different frequencies, perceived as periodic variations in phase difference [0, 2$\pi$] whose rate is the difference between the two frequencies. 
%
%  We prefer to use the frequency beating method to realize the synchronization for the SIS18 and the SIS100, which has more synchronization chances compared with just once of the phase shift method. Fig.~\ref{fig2} shows the schematic of the synchronization process in one SIS18 cycle. A broad description of the synchronization process is as follows. On the RF ramp of the source synchrotron, the RF frequency de-tune is achieved. After receiving the timing event (e.g. "Synchronization begin") from the timing network, the TR which is coupled to the RF system then informs the RF device to collect information, including the RF frequency, the harmonic number, the phase difference between the RF signal and the reference signal and the timestamp of the zero crossing point of RF signal h = 1. After collection data, the RF device transfers data to the TR. Then the TR sends data to the TR of the SIS100 via the timing network. At the same time, the SIS100 does the same procedures. Until now, both synchrotrons have all information for the synchronization so that they are able to calculate the propagation of uncertainties~\cite{error_propogation} of the phase difference measurement, the coarse window. Besides, both synchrotrons resynchronize the RF signals of each other locally. With the help of the coarse window and the resynchronized RF signals, both synchrotrons trigger their kickers with precision better than 0.5$^\circ$, which makes the RF frequency beating method possible.

%\end{figure}
%
%  This paper, does not contain a detailed technical description of the synchronization process, rather is devoted to demonstrating the RF frequency de-tune from the viewpoint of beam dynamics and the theory of the frequency beating method instead, especially focusing on the bunch to bucket transfer from the SIS18 to the SIS100.
%
%
%
%\section{\label{sec:level1}Beam-dynamics view of the Frequency De-tune}
%
%  The first step for the bunch to bucket transfer is the RF frequency de-tune. In order to realize the frequency beating between two synchrotrons, the RF frequency of the source synchrotron or the target synchrotron or both synchrotrons can be de-tuned. It means that the particles on the de-tuned synchrotron run at an average radius different by $\bigtriangleup$R from the designed orbit R. For the synchronization of the SIS18 and the SIS100, we will de-tune the RF frequency on the SIS18. The SIS18 operates with a cycle length of 520ms, harmonic number of 2 ( h = 2 ), and RF frequency of approximately 0.43 MHz at injection and approximately 1.57 MHz at ejection for the $U^{28+}$~\cite{SIS18}. During nominal operation, the SIS18 forms two bunches from the beam injected at 11.4 MeV/$\mu$ and accelerates them up to 200 MeV/$\mu$. From the SIS18, 4 batches, each of 2 bunches, are transferred at  maximum 10ms intervals to the SIS100. The harmonic number of the SIS100 is 10 and the SIS100 RF frequency is fixed at approximately 1.57 MHz during the
%injection period to simplify the RF control system and to avoid perturbing batches already transferred.
%
%  This RF frequency de-tune is done accompanying with the RF ramp. Accepting to decentre the orbit by 8mm for the SIS18~\cite{SIS18_man}: 
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\bigtriangleup{R}}{R}\approx{2.4}{\times}10^{-4}\label{eq1}
%\end{equation}
%
%  We know the basic differential relations among the fractional change in the RF frequency f, the fractional change in the momentum p, the fractional change in the bending magnetic field B and the fractional change in the radius R as follows ~\cite{J-PARC}.
%
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:eq2}
%\frac{\Delta{f}}{f} ={\frac{1}{\gamma^2}}{\frac{\Delta{p}}{p}} - \frac{\Delta{R}}{R}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\Delta{f}}{f} = (\frac{1}{\gamma^2}-\frac{1}{\gamma_t^2})\frac{\Delta{p}}{p}+{\frac{1}{\gamma_t^2}}{\frac{\Delta{B}}{B}}
%\label{eq:eq3}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%  where $\gamma$ is the relativistic factor, which measures the total particle energy, E, in
%units of the particle rest energy, $E_0$; $\gamma_t$ is the transition gamma; $\bigtriangleup{f}$ and  $\bigtriangleup{B}$ are the frequency and  bending magnetic field deviation for the frequency de-tune;  $\bigtriangleup{p}$ is the momentum deviation.
%
%  For J-PARC synchronizing the RCS (Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron)  with the MR (Main Ring) or the MLF (Materials and Life Science Facility), the RF phase shift of the RCS is adopted~\cite{J-PARC}. To achieve a required phase shift, the RF frequency is modulated away from the required value for a period of time and then modulated back, when the extraction and injection energy match again.  During its synchronization process, the magnetic field is not affected by the frequency change, namely $\Delta$B = 0. 
%
%  In our case of the frequency beating method, we guarantee the extraction and injection energy always match, which means that the momentum is not affected by the frequency change, namely $\Delta$p = 0; then the general relation between the radial excursion and RF frequency change Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq2}) reduces to Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq4}) and the general relation between the magnetic field change and RF frequency change Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq3}) reduces to Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq5}).
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\Delta{f}}{f} = - \frac{\Delta{R}}{R}
%\label{eq:eq4}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\Delta{f}}{f} =  \frac{1}{{\gamma_t}^2}\times{\frac{\Delta{B}}{B}}
%\label{eq:eq5}
%\end{equation}
%
%From these equations, the RF frequency and the magnetic field change at the $U^{28+}$  extraction energy 200MeV/u~\cite{SIS18_man} ($\gamma_t$ = 5.8) are 
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\Delta{f}}{f} = -{2.4}{\times}10^{-4}
%\label{eq6}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}\frac{\Delta{B}}{B} = -{8.1}{\times}10^{-3}\label{eq5}
%\end{equation}
%
%where the maximum RF frequency de-tune is approximate to 370 Hz at 1.57 MHz for the $U^{28+}$. In this paper, we assume Rf frequency de-tune for the SIS18 equals to 200 Hz for the sake of simplicity.
%
%\section{\label{sec:level1}Synchronization of two machines}
%
%The second step for the bunch to bucket transfer is the synchronization of two synchrotrons using the frequency beating method. After the RF frequency de-tunes on the source synchrotron, the relative rf phase of the two synchrotrons begins to slip at a repetition rate of the absolute value of the difference in two RF frequency. When the correct amount of phase is accumulated, the bunch of the source synchrotron will align or be cogged with the bucket of the target synchrotron.
%
%\subsubsection{The test setup}
%
%Because the RF device is still under development, we use two MODEL DS345 Synthesized Function Generators~\cite{FG} with the frequency accuracy of $\pm$5 ppm of the selected frequency to simulate RF signals from RF cavities of the SIS18 and the SIS100. Two TRs, the FPGA-based cards, are responsible for the time/phase measurement, information transmission and coarse window calculation. (see Fig.~\ref{fig3})
%
%\begin{figure}[!htb]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics*[width=90mm]{2pexaira.jpg}
%   \caption{The test setup for the bunch to bucket transfer.}
%   \label{fig3}
%\end{figure}
%
%\subsubsection{The frequency beating method}
%
%Here we still assume that the source synchrotron is the SIS18 and the target synchrotron is the SIS100. The RF frequency of the SIS18 is denoted by $f_{rf}^{SIS18}$ and that of the SIS100 by $f_{rf}^{SIS100}$. ${\bigtriangleup{f}}$ is the RF frequency de-tune value of the SIS18. n is the number of the SIS100 revolution period to realize the synchronization. $t_{18best}$ and $t_{100best}$ are the timestamps of the zero-crossing point of the RF signals measured by the TRs. According to the measurement results, there are two scenarios.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item  $t_{18best} < t_{100best}$
%    \begin{equation}
%   t_{100best}+{n}\times{\frac{1}{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}}=t_{18best}+{(n+1)}\times{\frac{1}{(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+{\bigtriangleup{f}})}}
%   \end{equation}
%    \item  $t_{18best} > t_{100best}$
%    \begin{equation}
%   t_{100best}+{n}\times{\frac{1}{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}}=t_{18best}+{n}\times{\frac{1}{(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+{\bigtriangleup{f}})}}
%   \end{equation}
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%Based on these two scenarios, we could deduce the formulas for the number of the SIS100 revolution n and the time  $t_{syn}$ spend on the synchronization.
%
%\begin{equation}
%n=\frac{t_{100best}-t_{18best}-\frac{\bigtriangleup{n}}{f_{rf}^{SIS18}+{\bigtriangleup{f}}}}{\frac{1}{f_{rf}^{SIS18}+{\bigtriangleup{f}}}-\frac{1}{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}}\label{eq6}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%t_{syn}=\frac{(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+{\bigtriangleup{f}})\times{t_{18best}}-f_{rf}^{SIS100}\times{t_{100best}}+{\bigtriangleup{n}}}{(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+{\bigtriangleup{f}})-f_{rf}^{SIS100}}\label{eq7}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\bigtriangleup{n}$ equals 1 when  $t_{18best} < t_{100best}$ and equals 0 when  $t_{18best} > t_{100best}$.
%
%\subsubsection{The coarse window and an example}
%
%The coarse window is the result of the propagation of uncertainties of the phase difference measurements. The uncertainties in $f_{rf}^{SIS18}$, $f_{rf}^{SIS100}$, $t_{18best}$ and $t_{100best}$ are independent and random, then the uncertainty~\cite{error_propogation} in the synchronization time $t_{syn}$ is
%
%\begin{widetext}
%\begin{equation}
%\delta {t_{syn}}=\sqrt{(\frac{\partial{t_{syn}}}{\partial{t_{18best}}}{\delta{t_{18}}})^{2}+(\frac{\partial{t_{syn}}}{\partial{t_{100best}}}{\delta{t_{100}}})^{2}+(\frac{\partial{t_{syn}}}{\partial{f_{rf}^{SIS18}}}{\delta{f_{rf}^{SIS18}}})^{2}+(\frac{\partial{t_{syn}}}{\partial{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}}{\delta{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}})^{2}} 
%\label{eq:coarse}
%\end{equation}
%\end{widetext}
%
%
%After calculation, we get the result of $\delta$$t_{syn}$
%
%\begin{align*}
%&A=\frac{(f_{rf}^{SIS100})^2+(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+\bigtriangleup{f})^2}{\bigtriangleup{f}^2}\nonumber\\
%&B=\frac{2\times{[(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+\bigtriangleup{f})\times(t_{18best}-t_{100best})+{\bigtriangleup{n}}]^2}}{\bigtriangleup{f}^4}\nonumber\\
%&C=\frac{2\times{(f_{rf}^{SIS18}+\bigtriangleup{f})}\times(t_{18best}-t_{100best})^2}{\bigtriangleup{f}^3}+\nonumber\\
%&      \frac{2\times{\bigtriangleup{n}}\times(t_{18best}-t_{100best})}{\bigtriangleup{f}^3}\\
%&D=\frac{(t_{18best}-t_{100best})^2}{\bigtriangleup{f}^2}\nonumber\\
%\end{align*}
%\begin{equation}
%\delta {t_{syn}}=(A\times\delta{t}^2+B\times\delta{f}^2-C\times\delta{f}^2+D\times\delta{f}^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\label{eq8}
%\end{equation}
%
%where we assume that $f_{rf}^{SIS18}$=$f_{rf}^{SIS100}$ = 1.57 MHz, the RF frequency of the flattop of the SIS18 and of the injection of the SIS100 for the $U^{28+}$, $\bigtriangleup{f}$=200 Hz. In the real situation, the uncertainty of the phase difference measurement from the RF device is 50 ps, $\delta$$t_{18}$ = $\delta$$t_{100}$ = $\delta{t}$ = 50 ps. Because the RF frequency has the long term stability in the real RF system, $\int\delta{f_{rf}^{SIS18}}dt$ = $\int\delta{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}dt$ = 0. 
%
%Based on these assumptions, the coarse window is $\pm$\unit[0.55][$\mu$s] of the best estimation. The maximum time for the synchronization is 
%
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{1}{\Delta{f}} = \frac{1}{200 Hz} = 5 ms\label{eq9}
%\end{equation}
%
%Based on this window, we make use of the first SIS100 revolution signal after the $t_{syn}$ - 0.55us and the following SIS18 revolution signal to trigger kickers. In order to guarantee that each bucket has opportunity to be injected, the whole period of the first SIS100 revolution signal is available. So the accuracy within this period is better than 0.5$^\circ$
%
%\begin{equation}
%{\frac{6.4 \mu s}{5ms}}\times {360^\circ} \approx 0.46^\circ\label{eq9}
%\end{equation}
%
%Where 6.4 $\mu$s is the revolution period of the SIS100.
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{1}{f_{rf}^{SIS100}}\times {h} = \frac{1}{1.57 MHz}\times {10} = 6.4 \mu s \label{eq10}
%\end{equation}
%
%\subsubsection{Test result}
%This setup theoretically simulates the synchronization of two synchrotrons, with accuracy better than 0.5$^\circ$ (see Table~\ref{tab:table1}). It paves the way for the further FAIR bunch to bucket transfer. \\
