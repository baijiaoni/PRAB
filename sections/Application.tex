For the FAIR B2B transfer system, both the phase shift and frequency beating methods are applicable. However, many FAIR accelerator pairs can only use the frequency beating method because of the non-integer ratio of the circumference between two rings. Besides, FAIR has many use cases of the B2B transfer that the extraction and injection beam have different energy because of targets installed between two rings. In this case, the beam revolution frequency ratio between the small and large accelerators is used to calculate the synchronization frequencies instead of the circumference ratio between the large and small accelerators. Therefore, the FAIR B2B transfer system with the frequency beating method is applied for all FAIR use cases, see Tab. ~\ref{use_application}.

Tab. ~\ref{use_application} shows that for most primary beam transfers of FAIR use cases, the B2B transfer with the B2B injection center mismatch less than $\pm1^\circ$ can be achieved, because the circumference ratio between two rings is an integer or close to an integer. For the B2B transfer between two rings with a far away circumference ratio, the B2B injection center mismatch is $\pm1.2^\circ$, which is just beyond the specification and still acceptable. However, the system is also required for the FAIR use cases that secondary beams are generated by the pbar target, the FRS or the Super-FRS with an arbitrary energy ratio between the primary and secondary beams. For the rare isotope beam (RIB) transfer from the SIS100 to the CR via the Super-FRS with the \SI{1.5}{GeV/u} primary beam energy and the \SI{740}{MeV/u} secondary beam energy, the B2B injection center mismatch is only $\pm2.1^\circ$ by coincidence. For the antiproton B2B transfer from the SIS100 to the CR via the pbar target and the RIB transfer form the SIS18 to the ESR via the FRS, the B2B injection center mismatch is as large as $\pm41.5^\circ$, which is far beyond the upper bound injection center mismatch. For detailed parameters of the FAIR B2B transfer use cases, please see Appendix. ~\ref{appendix}


Fig. ~\ref{1st_2nd_1} shows the positive B2B injection center mismatch of the RIB B2B transfer from the SIS100 to the CR via the Super-FRS with the different primary and secondary beam energies. The negative mismatch is just the additive inverse of the positive mismatch. Fig. ~\ref{1st_2nd_2} shows the positive mismatch of the proton B2B transfer from the SIS100 to the CR via the pbar target and Fig. ~\ref{1st_2nd_3} shows the positive mismatch of the beam transfer from the SIS18 to the ESR via the FRS.
